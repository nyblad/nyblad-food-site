# Project 7 - Build a Food Review website (group project)

During week 7 @ Technigo Bootcamp we had a meet-up in Stockholm and our team was challenged to build a website that lists restaurants, reviews and information based on location.

For my portfolio-repo I have changed some of our original code and added some comments in it.<br><br>

Our team (team Purple) was given supposed to use the Zomato API to list Pizza restaurants in Dublin in the style of the Deliveroo site (https://deliveroo.ie/restaurants/dublin/dublin-2).
