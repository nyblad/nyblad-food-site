# Project 7 - Build a Food Review website (group project)

During week 7 @ Technigo Bootcamp we had a meet-up in Stockholm and our team was challenged to build a website that lists restaurants, reviews and information based on location.

Our team (team Purple) was given supposed to use the Zomato API to list Pizza restaurants in Dublin in the style of the Deliveroo site: ![Deliveroo](https://i.imgur.com/GHFJy1k.png)

For my portfolio-repo I have changed some of our original code and added some comments in it.
